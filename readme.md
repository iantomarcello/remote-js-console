# Remote JS Console
A lightweight service that pass outputs of `console` to a local central to be read.
The central is generally your main device with the text editor.

Works by hosting a local Websocket server to catch the and output `console`
messages, while the clients connect to the Websocket and ping said messages
via a `console` Proxy. 

Made to debug <s>the crap that is</s> Safari on non-iOS devices.
